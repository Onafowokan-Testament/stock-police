# Stock Market Alert System ðŸ“ˆ

Welcome to the **Stock Market Alert System**! This Python script monitors stock price changes for a specified company (e.g., Tesla) and sends email alerts with relevant news articles if the stock price changes significantly (more than 1%). It integrates with the **Alpha Vantage API** for stock data and the **NewsAPI** for fetching the latest news.
